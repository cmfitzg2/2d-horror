this doc serves as a place for me to jot down ideas that occur to me. none of them are final or fully refined.

idea for game:
	-Main Character (MC) and friends group up and head to house of horrors
	-house of horrors is actually a metaphor / psychological cope for MC who is experiencing grief
	-house of horrors has several trap rooms with one possible escape for MC
	-each of MC's friends represent a stage of grief, and will have a unique trap room (event) that personifies that stage
	-each event should be something that results in the death of the friend while also being superficially MC's fault, but all are unavoidable
	-player transcends & escapes house after the death of each stage's character, culminating in Acceptance.

early game - character building, but how??
	-if we're going the way of "this is all in MC's head", narrative doesn't need to be linear (like a dream, you're just there, like Inception)
	-but we do need some way of introducing characters / getting the player attached
	-so whats the location they're going? why would they all go?
		-schoolmates? game starts out with them hanging out in class / outside
		-cheap and easy but cliche: lets check out the haunted old house ooo aaa
		-mystique: the house is known for something like finding closure / revealing yourself / some other gay shit
		-each character could have a reason to want to go, even though MC is the only one that matters

i think each event should take place in such a way that MC + the character can speak / interact but can't reach eachother (something like jailbars?)

denial
	character:
		-wants to go because they want to prove it's all bullshit
		-"this is so stupid"
		-"you guys will seriously believe anything"
		-should be the least interesting / player-invested character since we're killing them first
	event:
		-player has to tap button / click to keep Denial from dying to some inevitable threat (holding wall up that crushes, guillotine, etc).
		-can't be won, eventually the event will happen in spite of player's efforts
		-autoclicker -> you can't cheat death, you'll never move on like this, etc.

anger
	character:
		-wants to go because 
			-they want to prove they already know themselves fine?
			-they want to prove they're not scared?
		-character needs to be fiery, mean, but also just straight-forward, doesn't beat around the bush
		-authentic but blunt

	event:
		idea 1:
			-in frustration, MC beats up on something -- Anger experiences whatever MC does
			-literally need to beat Anger to death to escape room
			-suits the stage, but prevents final dialogue between the two (suboptimal!!)
		idea 2:
			-i'm thinking

bargaining
	character:
		-doesn't want to go, gets goaded into it.
		-giant pussy, but also a mediator / tries to keep peace
		-nice guy, just wants everyone to be happy
		-naive

	event:
		idea 1:
			-some sort of situation where Bargaining is trapped in room with another new character who's going to kill him (for some reason)
			-MC can see / talk but can't reach
			-MC has the opportunity to progress through dialogues that bargain with new character not to do it
			-can go on for however long, but aggressor has an answer to everything MC says and eventually does it anyway
			-

depression
	character:
		-wants to go because they have nothing else going on, who cares
		-"beats spending the night with myself"
		could be funny, make a lot of depressing sarcastic quips (aka red flags!!! for depression!!!)
		"is there anything scarier than really knowing yourself? only the alternative I guess."

	event:
		-suicide, player unwittingly contributes to it 
		-takes stool from player's inventory and hangs self?
			-ceiling pull-down switch that allows player to get out? idk man.
			-would need to be a reason Depression committing is necessary for player's escape, or is at least one possible solution
			-Depresison already wants to commit, doesn't need to be the *only* solution.

acceptance
	character:
		-this could be a real person in MC's life, the one who has died, and who MC is going through grief for
		-wants to go because they want to help MC
		-best friend type, loyal, hints that they know what's going on throughout the game
		-as the final stage, they need to let the player know what's going on, maybe subtle, maybe obvious
		-"MC, you have to let me go. that's why we're here." except less contrived
		-probably he or MC should initiate the idea to go to the house

	event:
		idea 1:
			-trapped in adjacent rooms, MC's room has panel that controls ascent / descent of each room
			-if MC ascends, Acceptance descends and vice versa
			-ascent = escape, descent = death
			-ascending and escaping is both literally and metaphorically how MC escapes (ascends) cycle of grief

post-game:
	-character wakes up from this delusion
	-attends funeral for Acceptance?
	-other stages of grief are real friends in real world and they're all fine?

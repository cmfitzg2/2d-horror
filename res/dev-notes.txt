there is an issue with rendering order when part of one entity needs to be rendered differently from another part
the example:
the mansion should be drawn after the top of the gate so that it appears to be inside of the gate.
however, the bottom of the gate should be drawn after the mansion for the same reason

additionally, because the mansion's y position is in the part of the gate that says the entity should be drawn after the gate,
the mansion will perpetually sort the gate before it, meaning it will get locked into the first draw position by the mansion
meaning the player will always be drawn after the gate -- so when inside the gate, at the bottom, the player will be drawn on top of it.
the unfortunate solution? explicitly handle rendering vs specific entities in the custom rendering method
if we say mansion always > gate, the mansion will always draw on top of the gate, meaning we can't have the front gate overlap it
however, this will allow the player to be sorted vs the gate

i suspect this issue will cause many issues down the line. need to think through render sorting in a better way...........


nevermind ^ this didn't work, it's still busted.

5/3/2021, a day that will go down in infamy as long as this problem doesn't resurface:
the fix was to stop extending the sorting criteria infinitely left/right or up/down, 
and instead only check if the entity is inside the bounds of the entity being compared to (strictly a subset of the standard height compare)
